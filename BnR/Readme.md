Bully Algorithm:
The Bully algorithm is a centralized algorithm for leader election in a distributed system. It assumes that each process in the system has a unique ID, and the process with the highest ID is elected as the leader.
Here's a step-by-step description of the Bully algorithm:

When a process detects that the leader has failed or is unreachable, it starts the election process by sending an Election message to all processes with higher IDs.
If a process receives an Election message, it responds by sending an OK message back to the requesting process.
If a process doesn't receive any OK messages within a certain timeout period, it assumes it has the highest ID and declares itself as the new leader.
The newly elected leader sends a Coordinator message to inform all other processes of its leadership status.
If a process receives a Coordinator message, it recognizes the sender as the leader and updates its own information accordingly.
The Bully algorithm ensures that the process with the highest ID becomes the leader. However, it assumes a centralized communication mechanism where processes can directly communicate with each other.

Ring Algorithm:
The Ring algorithm is a decentralized algorithm for leader election in a distributed system. It relies on a logical ring structure among the processes, where each process is aware of its immediate neighbors.
Here's a step-by-step description of the Ring algorithm:

Each process starts in an idle state, waiting for an election trigger.
When a process wants to start an election, it sends an Election message to its neighbor in a specific direction (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise).
Upon receiving an Election message, a process compares its own ID with the one in the message:
If its ID is higher, it sends the message to the next neighbor.
If its ID is lower, it discards the message.
If its ID is equal, it declares itself as the leader, sends a Coordinator message in the opposite direction, and informs all other processes.
If a process receives a Coordinator message, it updates its information and recognizes the sender as the leader.
If a process doesn't receive any Election message within a certain timeout period, it assumes it has the highest ID and initiates the election process by sending an Election message.
The Ring algorithm ensures that the process with the highest ID in the logical ring becomes the leader. It relies on message passing between neighboring processes, with each process making a comparison based on its own ID.
